* Motor error (MDR 13124770)
* Flow blocked alarm (MDR 13124964)

These errors resulted in no harm requiring medical intervention, except for one instance where the pump alarmed with an open book image. The reports also mentioned physical damage to the device, such as cracks and cosmetic damage.

It's worth noting that some reports were unable to determine whether the device caused or contributed to the event due to a lack of product return or further analysis.","Mentions include “motor error”, “critical pump error”, “alarm 25”, and an “open book image” (MDRs 13125039, 13124913)."

However, some reports indicate device damage, such as cracks and cosmetic damage, with issues related to the retainer ring, belt clip, or LCD window.

Insulin delivery inconsistencies are not directly mentioned in the reports, but one report (MDR 13125903) mentions that the customer experienced nausea, vomiting, and sickness due to high blood glucose levels, which may be related to an insulin delivery issue. However, this is not a clear indication of a device leak or delivery inconsistency.

It appears that some users have reported issues with their devices, but these issues do not directly relate to device leaks or insulin delivery inconsistencies.","Indirectly. Flow‑blocked alarms and critical pump errors are reported (e.g., MDR 13124964), suggesting delivery obstruction; explicit leaks are not confirmed."

Most of the reports indicate that the device may have contributed to the event, but due to lack of product returned, further analysis and conclusion cannot be drawn at this time.

Reports MDR 13124781, 13124796, 13124840, and 13124990 mention that devices similar to the Paradigm Real-Time Insulin Infusion Pump are involved, which is not marketed in the United States. However, these reports do not explicitly state whether the device malfunctioned or caused harm.

In contrast, Report MDR 13124624 suggests a potential issue with the insulin pump, as it indicates a motor error alarm was reported, but no harm requiring medical intervention was experienced.","Yes. “Critical pump error”/motor error alarms are cited (e.g., MDRs 13125039, 13124913), with clinical impact in the latter."

However, devices with physical damage were found in reports MDR 13124893 and MDR 13124938. In report MDR 13124893, the pump had cracked on the pump but no harm requiring medical intervention was reported. This is because the customer returned the pump for analysis, which suggests that the device was still functional despite physical damage.

In contrast, devices with physical damage were flagged as adverse events when they caused harm or malfunction, such as report MDR 13124913 where the patient experienced high blood glucose levels and diabetic ketoacidosis.

Therefore, while some devices with physical damage may not be flagged as adverse events, physical damage can still pose a risk if it leads to malfunction or causes harm.","Yes. Many physical‑damage cases are flagged “No AE” (e.g., MDRs 13125827, 13125903)."
